10. **Continuous Integration and Monitoring**
    - CI/CD Setup with GitHub Actions
    - Monitor API Calls and Lambda Functions with AWS CloudWatch
    - Set Up Alerts for Critical Issues

### Flow Chart Visualization:
To visualize this in a flow chart tool:

- **Boxes**: Represent different components (e.g., Screens, AWS Services).
- **Arrows**: Indicate the flow of data and user actions.
- **Labels**: Provide additional context for each step.

Hereâ€™s a simplified textual representation to help you visualize:

```
Start -> App Entry Point -> Authentication Screens
    -> [Login Screen]
    -> [Signup Screen]
    -> [Forgot Password Screen]
    -> Main App Screens
        -> [Home Screen] -> [Profile Screen] -> [Booking Screen] -> [Confirmation Screen]
        -> [Favorites Screen] -> [Profile Screen]
        -> [Notifications Screen]
        -> [Settings Screen]
    -> Backend Services
        -> Authentication
        -> GraphQL API
        -> Data Storage
        -> File Storage
        -> Notifications
    -> Database Schema
        -> Users Table
        -> Providers Table
        -> Sessions Table
        -> Reservations Table
        -> Locations Table
        -> Transactions Table
        -> UserRatings Table
        -> ProviderRatings Table
        -> UserNotifications Table
        -> ProviderNotifications Table
        -> Photos Table
        -> ProviderAvailability Table
    -> Booking a Session Workflow
    -> Viewing and Managing Reservations Workflow
    -> Ratings and Reviews Workflow
    -> Security and Permissions
    -> Continuous Integration and Monitoring
```

Using a flowchart tool, you can create boxes for each component and link them with arrows to represent the workflow and data flow as described. This will provide a visual representation of the Buddy App's system design.
